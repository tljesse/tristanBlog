A few weeks have passed and I've found the time to wash out my [Hexo Theme](https://hexo.io/docs/themes.html) and release it for others to use. You clone or download the full theme on my public github [here](https://github.com/tljesse/tristanJesseHexo).

## Briefly on Customization
I've taken out just about everything that is custom to my site and made it so you can put whatever you want. Since [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) is really more of a blog engine I had to make some hard coded pages within the theme but I have left instructions for you to customize them all. Specifically, the index page (index.ejs) will have to customized and both the portfolio page (portfolio.ejs) and the contact page (contact.ejs) will have to be generated and custoimized in both their index files of their pages as well as some HTML on the portfolio page.

My [last post](http://www.tristanjesse.com/2017/07/17/Shaking-Things-Up/) goes into a lot more detail on the technologies behind everything I did so I won't go into it again here. If you have any thoughts or issues with the theme let me know and I'll try to sort them out. Enjoy!
